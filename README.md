Web calculator using Javascript

I used the iPhone calculator as a reference for this project. Just an FYI for anyone wondering why I used Flexbox for all of the CSS; I know CSS grid would have been easier, but The Odin Project for some reason didn't find it ideal to teach Grid before giving these more complex projects. I am trying to do this with the tools TOP teaches even though I know CSS Grid.
